# Loan Approval Data Engineering Project

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a data-engineering / machine-learning pipeline for loan approval prediction. It includes steps to load data into a database, train a model, and expose an API or application for making predictions.

## ✅ Features  

- Loads loan-applicant and financial data and stores into database (via `load_Database.py`)  
- Trains a machine-learning model to predict loan approval (via `Train_Model.py`)  
- Provides a simple application or API (via `App.py`) to make predictions given applicant / loan / financial info  
- Example JSON files (`applicant_info.json`, `financial_info.json`, `loan_info.json`) to test / feed into the application  

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sankyyy28/Loan_Approval_Data_Engineering_project.git
   cd Loan_Approval_Data_Engineering_project
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`  
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
4. Load data into database:

   ```bash
   python load_Database.py  
   ```
5. Train the model (if retraining is needed):

   ```bash
   python Train_Model.py  
   ```

   This will generate (or overwrite) `loan_approval_model.pkl`.
6. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python App.py  
   ```

   Then you can use the example JSON files to test predictions.

## 💡 Usage Example

```bash
python App.py --input applicant_info.json --financial financial_info.json --loan loan_info.json  
```

*(Adjust command/flags depending on how App.py is implemented)*

## 📂 Input & Output Formats

* Input should follow the JSON schema defined in `applicant_info.json`, `financial_info.json`, `loan_info.json`.
* Output will be a loan approval prediction (e.g. “Approved” / “Rejected” / probability etc.).

## 🧪 (Optional) Training / Retraining

* If you want to retrain the model with new data, update the data source, then run `Train_Model.py`.
* The output is saved as `loan_approval_model.pkl`.

## 📄 Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for Python libraries used.

## Why This Structure Matters  

- A well-organized README with “What”, “How”, “Why”, “Usage” helps other developers quickly understand and use the repository. This improves usability and potential collaboration. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Including installation instructions, usage examples and contribution guidelines encourages adoption and contributions.

If you like — I can **generate a full markdown README** (with badges, license placeholder, sample usage, explanation) ready to paste into your repo.  
Do you want me to build that for you now?
